data_mining
===========
This was an individual project, done along with 'Data Mining and Data Warehousing' course to perform all the data mining phases (pre-processing, clustering and classification) on a given earthquake dataset with thousands of rows representing the occurrences of earthquakes across India. The goal was to infer some relevant information which could be helpful in locating the different earthquake zones across the country.

For more details, please refer the methods/programs/strategies used for the various phases of data mining.
